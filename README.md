# BookStore

Program was initailly created for a university project in 2018. However due to positve feedback i've deciceded
to publish my work to GitHub with the intention of improving the code through this platform.

In short: 
 * Program that sells books to one of 3 customers (Customer Id's 1, 2 or 3).
 * Authors and distributers have each their own sales charts.
 * Chart displays best selling author and best selling distributer
 
 I hope people view this code as a step in the right direction for me of improving my programming
 skills but also getting to grips with GitHub.
